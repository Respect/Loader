Respect\Loader
==============

A simple, minimalist class loader that implements the PSR-0 spec.

Configuration
-------------

Respect\Loader needs the include_path properly configured. Add your library to
the include_path directive in php.ini or set up in runtime like this:

    set_include_path('/path/to/library'. PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());

See http://php.net/include_path for more info.

Usage
-----

Add this single line one single time to your project:

    spl_autoload_register(include 'Respect/Loader.php');
